What is LZO ?
=============

LZO is a portable lossless data compression library written in ANSI C.
It offers pretty fast compression and *very* fast decompression.
Decompression requires no memory.

In addition there are slower compression levels achieving a quite
competitive compression ratio while still decompressing at
this very high speed.


What is Perl ?
==============

Perl is an interpreted programming language optimized for scanning
text and useful for many system management tasks. To find out more,
point your browser to http://www.perl.org/ .


What is Perl-LZO ?
==================

Perl-LZO provides LZO bindings for Perl, i.e. you can access the
LZO library from your Perl scripts thereby compressing ordinary
Perl strings.


Where's the documentation ?
===========================

Have a look at the generated manpage `Compress::LZO.3pm'.

Additionally you should read the docs and study the example
programs that ship with the LZO library. Really.
